# Patcher
The patcher program uses the QT graphics library. The goal of the project was to ensure that when someone else's program starts, the words "Login is allowed" are displayed. Someone else's program asked the user for a password. My program changed the bytecode in the if-else and allowed the entry forever.<br/> 
The program was also hacked by a common buffer overflow.
